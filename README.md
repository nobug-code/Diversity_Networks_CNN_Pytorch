# Diversity_Networks_CNN_Pytorch

This project uses the Determinant point process, a method proposed by the Diversity Network.
It is a project that the model is lightened by applying it to a CNN model.

The code is built PyTorch and tested on Ubuntu 18.04 environment (Python3.6, PyTorch_1.2.0, CUDA10.1, cuDNN7) with 1080 GPUs.  model has also been merged into Pytorch
